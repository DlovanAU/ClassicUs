Our goal for the party menu is that you can see online created maps made by people in that section and that you can download them to play immediately just like our favourite game ***cough cough*** Geometry Dash and you'll be able to dislike or like the map *yes this is our inspiration from Geometry Dash*.
Not only that, later on we'll integrate a whole different gamemode on that section that you can play with your friends and wait in the lobby before it starts, EXCITING AND FUN IT WILL BE!!!
